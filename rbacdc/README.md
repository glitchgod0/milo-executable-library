# *AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack* Patches

## Strum Limit Fix
A patch to kill the 52ms cooldown on strums, causing songs with notes over 18NPS (see: "Green Grass and High Tides" from RB1 or "Trogdor" from GH2) to be unFCable. The PS2 patch works on emulator (and presumably console), and since track packs are single-layer discs, they're easily rebuilt and work great (or at least, as well as PS2 RB can).

## Vanilla
The final, retail executable with no fixes applied.
