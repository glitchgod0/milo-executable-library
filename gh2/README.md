# *Guitar Hero II* Patches

## PS2 Final Debug
The debug executable found in the Project Deluge dump of GH80's. Unlike the 80's debug, this one can be dropped into any GH2 disc, so long as the three drivers in the IOP folder come with it.

## HOPO fix
A patch to resolve the issue where missing a HOPO and quick-restarting causes that HOPO to require being strummed on the second run.

## PS2/TU0/TU1 Strum Limit Fix
A patch to kill the 52ms cooldown on strums, causing songs with notes over 18NPS (see: "Green Grass and High Tides" from RB1 or "Trogdor" from GH2) to be unFCable. TU0 refers to the disc build with no patches or updates applied.

## Vanilla
The final, retail executable with no fixes applied.
