# *Rock Band* Patches

## Strum Limit Fix
A patch to kill the 52ms cooldown on strums, causing songs with notes over 18NPS (see: "Green Grass and High Tides" from RB1 or "Trogdor" from GH2) to be unFCable. The PS2 patch works on emulator (and presumably console), but because we're unable to rebuild dual-layer discs properly, it's a relatively moot point.

## Vanilla
The final, retail executable with no fixes applied.
