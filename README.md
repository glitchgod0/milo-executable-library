# Milo Executable Library
The Harmonix rhythm game community has taken increasing steps to patch bugs present in the game's code itself--not the scripts as seen in the [Milo Script Library](https://github.com/mariteaux/milo-script-library) sister repo, but the actual game executables.

Further, for a couple games, we have proper debugging builds available to us, as Harmonix would often build debugging functions into the game itself and then patch those functions out on shipping builds.

This repo aims to round up as many of these unofficial bugfixed executables, plus the vanilla shipping and debug executables for comparison, as possible. If the executable requires extra files beyond what's already in the game files, they will be included here.
